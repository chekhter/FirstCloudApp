# My First Cloud Foundry App: Hello World, of course.

No App Router Involved; only requires an express module to run

Responds with Hello World to the GET '/' request, does pretty much nothing else.

## Installation

Go to the `app` directory and execute `npm install`. Return to root and upload the app with `cf push` afterwards
